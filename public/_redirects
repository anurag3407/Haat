# Netlify redirects file for SPA routing
# This ensures that all routes are handled by React Router

# SPA fallback - serve index.html for all routes that don't match files
/*    /index.html   200

# Optional: API proxy redirects (if you want to route API calls through Netlify)
# /api/*  https://your-backend-url.railway.app/api/:splat  200
